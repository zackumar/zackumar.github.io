# @newspaper_snippets and other Updates!

> March 2nd, 2021

Hello üôÉ.

I'm here again to give you some updates about different things. First let's start with some project stuff.

## @newspaper_snippets hotfixes

If you read my last post about [@newspaper_snippets](https://www.instagram.com/newspaper_snippets/), you learned what it was and how it works. Well, I've fixed some of the issues it had previously, **AND** I added more to it!

First off I fixed one of the main issues that it had, which was how I had to use a NodeJS library for Instagram integration. I found [instabot](https://pypi.org/project/instabot/), a python library, that allows me to post to Instagram. This helps a lot and makes everything cleaner and takes less space.

Secondly, I moved it to Heroku! I ran the first version of @newspaper_snippets on a home server. And by home server, I mean an old computer running Ubuntu Server. I know. Pretty high-tech if I do say so myself üòó. Running it on a home server was great for quick fixes and everything, but with the polar vortex that caused Texas to lose power, @newspaper_snippets was down for a week. That's why I moved it to Heroku. It's more reliable. Also, it's a good learning experience.

And now for the threequel. @newspaper_snippets now posts to Twitter! The handle for Twitter is [@news_snippets](https://twitter.com/news_snippets) because sadly @newspaper_snippets was too long to fit. Sads.

But yeah! That's about it for updates I guess. There is still a lot to do. I really want to add better focal point detections. And I think that'd be good. Also, I now have 4, did you hear that? **_FOUR_** followers on the @newspaper_snippets Instagram. Ain't that crazy? üòÇ JK. But that is actually kinda cool.

## Next update: Hiking!

I'm going hiking for this upcoming spring break. It's a four-day trip that I'm going on with two of my friends, and I'm pretty stoked about it. We're staying in an Airbnb, and it's really cool. It's an old western saloon in a historical site which was renovated and it's next to an observatory, so I hope that this trip will live up to my expectations. üòÄ

Okay! That's all I really have to say! I know no one has ever looked at these, but it's going to be a time capsule for me one day.

\- Love Zack ‚ù§Ô∏è

**TL:DR**: Better snippets. Tweety Birb. Hiking!

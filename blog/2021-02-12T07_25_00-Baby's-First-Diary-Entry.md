# Baby's First Diary Entry

Why hello there 👋. Welcome!

This is my first blog post! Wait no--blog post sounds to... old school 😗. So maybe... diary entry? Sure. I'll go with that. It has a fun touch to it that 'Blog Post' doesn't have.

First off, I don't expect anyone to really read this, but hey, one can only hope. This, along with all my other projects, is really supposed to be a side thing that I thought was kinda fun to put together. If you look at the source code of this website, you shall see that it is very crudly put together with no real organization at all. But it was more of a one-day build, so I'm going to give it some slack--sorry though. It was fun putting this together as it allowed to learn all the things for full stack development, along with markdown! Markdown is always a fun thing to use. It's just so simple.

Now, I'm just going to give some background on myself (you can clearly tell that this _is_ a diary entry because of that haphazard organization of it all :D). I'm Zack Umar. I'm a current first year pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio--though I'm currently in the process of applying to transfer to UT Austin. I have been in love with programming an all that jazz since I was about the age of ten? Maybe nine. Some early age like that. I code random projects, though most of them never really get out of that testing phase and into a full thing. When they do, I get really happy.

If you want to check out the small amount of projects that I deemed worthy to be public. You can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/zackumar). I also have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mcgoodmen) that I never use, and I got an Instagram, but that's private so there's no real use of giving it out.

Thanks for reading? If you did read? You'll probably see more entries, probably random like this describing life or like my though process on things or projects. Kinda like a little public diary.

**TL;DR**: I'm Zack. Am student. I code. I talk. Thank you ❤️.

# Tuition through Turmoil

> March 1st, 2021

Background: This was a commentary for one of my classes. I am currently attending UTSA, so some of it is pointed at the institution.

College is pricey—period. College has become synonymous with money. But even if higher education is usually viewed as a high reward venture, should we really be paying the same substantial fees for a degraded experience? It might not be as clear cut of an answer as most may think.

In light of the unexpected pandemic, many colleges have traded in their traditional face-to-face teaching model for an online experience. Following this, some schools have been reducing their cost of tuition. Schools such as Southern New Hampshire University and Franciscan University in Ohio are going as far as covering students’ full tuition for the fall semester of 2020 with reduced tuition of $10,000 for the following years, a drop of more than $20,000 for students. Even though many schools are changing their pricing model, UTSA still charges an average of $25,606 for the 2020-2021 year.

While it seems schools are easing up on tuition, UTSA didn’t make any substantial changes to their 2020-2021 fees compared to prior years, even though students are required to have an experience far from the norm. Some of the only fees waived are International Education and Transportation fees. Although this may seem like something advantageous to students, the two fees only add up to a measly $22 in total per semester. This has students wondering: “If we can’t have access to campus, why are we still paying so much?”

This is the question plaguing the minds of students struggling to make it successfully through online courses. According to a survey of 13,606 students by OneClass, 92% of students believe that tuition should be lowered and 35% considered withdrawing from school altogether. In the wake of online classes, many of us have fees that don’t make sense in an online environment. These fees include payment for athletic buildings, recreation halls, and other buildings that the majority of students may never step foot in at a time like this. Though these prices may not be as substantial as the cost of classes, it adds up to a fair amount.

In addition to unnecessary fees, 75% of OneClass’s participants are unhappy with the quality of online classes. A professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Todd Rose, says that if his children attended college, he would recommend that they go to a school that specializes in online education. Schools that specialize in online education have the resources and training to give an effective curriculum through live lectures and module-based learning. UTSA and many other institutions not designed for this model are frantically building an online environment that doesn’t meet the standards that they should. Software like Blackboard and Canvas are good starting points, but schools like SNHU have specialized software build for strictly online models. The rapid and largely underdeveloped change has caused students to stress and worry, and in the eyes of many institutions, students come first. This has led to some offering reduced tuition and scholarships, which can help both students and university alike by encouraging students to stay with them at an affordable rate. Other institutions should start doing more that will make students feel like the classes they are taking are worth the amount they are paying.

But that’s only one side of the debate. Despite colleges being unable to use campuses to the fullest, there are other expenses when it comes to online learning. These include infrastructure costs, administrative costs, technology staff, and many others—aspects that specialized schools already had in place. Contrary to what some may think, Zoom isn’t free. Rose says that the costs of going online aren’t much cheaper than in prior years. These operating fees are all hidden fees that indirectly affect students but are important for a school to run smoothly. Though Rose says, “I gotta be perfectly honest, that’s not really [students’] problem… that’s [the school’s] problem.” The cost of having to build an infrastructure that was haphazardly put together because of the pandemic shouldn’t be placed on students.

College is expensive, and money is hard to part with. The only partially successful switch from in-person to online classes has left everyone hanging by a thread—students and professors alike. But when it comes to the students, college is already a hefty fee, and having to pay the same price for a rather mediocre experience will cause potential applicants to reconsider attending college at all. UTSA may have to start looking into pricing models that would better benefit future attendees.

**TL;RD**: COVID college pricey. Pricing model problems.
